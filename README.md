# Advent Of Code
Advent of Code is a series of programming puzzles released one per day during the Advent period.
The main calendar is available [here](https://adventofcode.com/).

In this repository, I present to you solutions to all puzzles I have solved so far.
My programming language of choice is Python.

Python allows me to focus on the actual puzzle while not having to worry about language difficulties.
In addition, throwing something like a equation solver against some problems is also done easily.
And, as Python isn't really the performance beast, it also requires smart solutions rather than brute forcing multi thread applications.

My solutions in this repository attempt to solve each and every puzzle within a couple of seconds.
The structure of each puzzle day is the same: an `example.txt` file containing the mentioned example input, an `input.txt` file containing the actual input (not included in this repository), and two python files `1.py` and `2.py` for both parts of each puzzle.

Following this, there will be `README` files for each day containing solution explanations.
The original Puzzle descriptions as well as actual input files can all be found on the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) website.

That's it for now, I hope this repository might help you with some of the puzzles.
